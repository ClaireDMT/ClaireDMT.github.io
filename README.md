# Welcome to my Portfolio 👐

This portfolio only uses CSS and HTML because...keep it simple stupid! 💋

I started it right after my bootcamp graduation. I know, it's not good code. 🤷‍♀️  
I have been so busy with clients and teaching in the last years, that I had no time or almost no need to spend time on it. 💸

So this repository is solely worked on when I travel from 🇩🇪 to 🇫🇷, by train, for hours, without internet 🙉. It's my "passe-temps", also allowing self-reflection... 🚅 💭

### TO-DO LIST:
[ ] cleanup the CSS  
[ ] add a readings section  
[ ] add a side projects section  
[x] remove the work part (the résumé will do)
